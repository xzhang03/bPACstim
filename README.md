Current version V2

PCB designs in the PCB folder

Sender uses arduino uno with DFRobot LCD12864 shield (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1084.html, Digikey: DFR0287-ND)

Receiver uses Adafruit ITSY BITSY 32U4 5V 16MHZ (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3677, Digikey: 1528-2501-ND). Previous versions use Trinket Pro, which is generally being phased out due to bootloading shenanigans.

## How to order
1. Use one of the PCB printing services (e.g., [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), [PCBWAY](https://www.pcbway.com/), [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/), [etc](https://pcbshopper.com/)). Upload the zip Gerber files from [here](https://github.com/xzhang03/bPACstim/tree/main/PWMpulsebox%20v2%20PCB). The sizes are pre-set so just choose your quantity, color, etc... You are good to go with PCBs
2. Upload the [bill of materials excel files](https://github.com/xzhang03/bPACstim/tree/main/PWMpulsebox%20v2%20PCB) to [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/mylists/). The quantities are for 1 unit. For resisters, trimmers, and header pins, you are better off using bulk kits from Amazon/Ebay. Please feel free to ask me about replacements.
